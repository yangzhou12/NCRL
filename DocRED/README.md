# ATLOP
This Code is largely adapted from [ATLOP](https://github.com/wzhouad/ATLOP).

## Requirements
* Python (tested on 3.7.4)
* CUDA (tested on 11.2)
* [PyTorch](http://pytorch.org/) (tested on 1.7.0)
* [Transformers](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers) (tested on 3.4.0)
* numpy (tested on 1.18.5)
* [apex](https://github.com/NVIDIA/apex) (tested on 0.1)
* [opt-einsum](https://github.com/dgasmith/opt_einsum) (tested on 3.2.1)
* wandb
* ujson
* tqdm

## Dataset
The [DocRED](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/P19-1074/) dataset can be downloaded following the instructions at [link](https://github.com/thunlp/DocRED/tree/master/data). The expected structure of files is:
```
ATLOP
 |-- dataset
 |    |-- docred
 |    |    |-- train_annotated.json        
 |    |    |-- train_distant.json
 |    |    |-- dev.json
 |    |    |-- test.json
 |-- meta
 |    |-- rel2id.json
```

## Training and Evaluation
### DocRED
Train the BERT model on DocRED with the following command:

```bash
>> sh scripts/run_bert.sh  # for BERT
>> sh scripts/run_roberta.sh  # for RoBERTa
```

The training loss and evaluation results on the dev set are synced to the wandb dashboard.

The program will generate a test file `result.json` in the official evaluation format. You can compress and submit it to Colab for the official test score.



## Requirements

To install requirements:

```setup
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

>📋  Describe how to set up the environment, e.g. pip/conda/docker commands, download datasets, etc...

## Training

To train the model(s) in the paper, run this command:

```train
python train.py --input-data <path_to_data> --alpha 10 --beta 20
```

>📋  Describe how to train the models, with example commands on how to train the models in your paper, including the full training procedure and appropriate hyperparameters.

## Evaluation

To evaluate my model on ImageNet, run:

```eval
python eval.py --model-file mymodel.pth --benchmark imagenet
```

>📋  Describe how to evaluate the trained models on benchmarks reported in the paper, give commands that produce the results (section below).

<!-- ## Pre-trained Models

You can download pretrained models here:

- [My awesome model](https://drive.google.com/mymodel.pth) trained on ImageNet using parameters x,y,z. 

>📋  Give a link to where/how the pretrained models can be downloaded and how they were trained (if applicable).  Alternatively you can have an additional column in your results table with a link to the models. -->
