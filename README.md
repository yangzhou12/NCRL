# NCRL

This repository is the implementation of [None Class Ranking Loss for Document-Level Relation Extraction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.00476) (IJCAI 2022).

We make the NCRL loss function public. The experimental results on DocRED can be reproduced by replacing the loss function of [ATLOP](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.00476) with NCRL.
